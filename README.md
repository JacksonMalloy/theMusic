Music application built with vanilla JavaScript --INPROGRESS

This project is currently a work in progress. The goal for this project is to work on asyncronous vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation
in an application environment. 

**May have to implement a backend with a database in the future for the many audio and img files. 

I was curious about the audio web API so I implemented a few audio nodes for fun, enjoy.
